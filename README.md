# BOBPID
The goal here was to provide a basic but useful servo driver at very low cost (blank PIC 18F14k22's are under $2, the BOB PCB is $8, couple bucks misc parts) which could replace stepper motors in any standard application, such as 3D printers or CNC machines. 

It accepts both serial and step / direction inputs. The serial interface allows for feedback of status / position and easy tuning of the P.I.D. constants and setting options like the polarity of the output direction signal. Simple position goal setting and trap-plan motion is also available from the serial interface. The step / direction input allows it's use in any application where a standard stepper driver was intended. 

The output is PWM speed and direction which will drive most any standard H-Bridge or other motor driver.
